// Re-advertising a changed model set (memql-cockpit#361).
//
// The engine accepts Register EXACTLY ONCE, at the handshake -- its
// stream dispatcher has no case for a second one -- and Heartbeat carries
// apps but no labels. So a model pulled, removed, or newly allowed while
// this worker is connected is invisible to the cluster until the worker
// registers again, and registering again means reconnecting.
//
// That makes re-advertisement expensive in a way the app inventory is
// not, and the two constants below are what keep it from being reckless:
// the set is re-checked often enough that `ollama pull` is noticed within
// a minute, and a reconnect is spent only when the ADVERTISED labels
// actually changed, only when no work is in flight, and never twice in
// quick succession -- a runtime flapping up and down must not turn into a
// worker that reconnects forever.
//
// The sharing consent is part of the same advertisement (memql-cockpit
// #428): inference.serve rides Register's capability descriptor and
// nothing else, so it obeys the same rules -- with the one difference a
// WITHDRAWN consent needs, described at maybeReadvertiseModels.

//     owner changing who may use this machine.
//   - Nothing happens while work is in flight. A model finishing its pull
//     must not kill somebody's hour-long app session, a tool call halfway
//     through, or a sibling pull still downloading -- and the change will
//     still be there in a minute.
//   - Nothing happens twice inside modelReadvertiseMinInterval. A runtime
//     flapping between up and down would otherwise turn this worker into
//     one that reconnects forever, which is worse than a stale label.
//
// The THIRD guard has two exceptions. A one-shot request from
// RequestImmediateReadvertise is spent by the reconnect it asks for and by
// nothing else; an early return leaves it armed -- busy, or labels that
// have not changed YET because the policy reload naming the new model
// landed a moment after the request -- so the next evaluation still gets
// the bypass, rather than the machine that was mid-call being the one
// that waits out the floor.
//
// And a WITHDRAWN consent (cluster -> owner) skips the floor outright
// (memql-cockpit#428): until the cluster sees it, other people's prompts
// keep arriving on hardware the owner has taken back. The busy guard
// still holds -- work in flight is never cut short, the owner's own
// included -- but while the withdrawal waits the heartbeat loop re-checks
// every withdrawalPoll rather than every minute, so it lands at the first
// idle second.
//
// The worker does NOT refuse new calls to get idle sooner. The engine
// treats any error a worker ends a call with as the call having run and
// does not reroute it, so a refusal would fail the call -- the owner's
// own planner call among them, for as long as a long app session kept the

// RequestImmediateReadvertise says the local model set just changed and
// SOMEBODY IS WATCHING -- the caller pulled a model, on purpose, in
// front of a person who pressed a button.
//
// Two things happen, and they are one call because a caller that did
// only the first would ship the bug this method exists to prevent:
//
//  1. The cached inventory is dropped. Discovery is cached for
//     DefaultModelInventoryTTL, and a model pulled a moment ago is not in
//     a probe taken a minute before it. Re-advertising without this
//     spends a reconnect to re-register the labels from BEFORE the pull:
//     the reconnect happens, nothing changes, and the pull reads to the
//     person watching as one that did nothing.
//  2. The two-minute floor is waived for the next evaluation, once. Two
//     minutes of a model that does not appear is indistinguishable from
//     a failed pull, and the person is looking at the screen.
//
// The BUSY guard is NOT waived, deliberately. A reconnect that kills a
// running model call or an hour-old app session is worse than a label
// that is a minute stale, and somebody watching a pull is not a reason
// to throw away somebody else's work. The request survives that wait.
//
// WHO CALLS IT, and from where. Only something inside THIS process can,
// and the cockpit's own pull path runs in another one: `memql worker
// models --pull` and `memql worker setup --inference` reach the running
// worker through the SIGHUP they already send after writing
// models.allow, and the handler in cli.go asks for this after reloading
// the policy -- a reloaded allow list that nobody re-advertised is a
// model the cluster still cannot see. The same reload is how a changed
// inference.serve reaches the runner. The cluster's own ModelPullStart
// arm (modelpull.go) calls it directly, after reloading the policy
// itself and AFTER sending its End: the reconnect this asks for closes
// the stream that End rides.
