// computer -- so it gets the same posture the rest of this file has:
// nothing runs until the machine's owner says which app may. A cluster the
// block does not name is allowed NOTHING, which is the state of every
// machine that has not been configured and of every cluster paired after
// the owner wrote this block.
//
// PER CLUSTER, because consent here is the owner's word about one cluster.
// A single machine-wide list meant that allowing Claude Code to test it
// against a local cluster offered it to production too -- the crossing the
// per-home tool consent windows already rule out (consent/homes.go,
// memql-cockpit#433). The machine-wide `apps.allow` this replaced is not
// read at all; a file that still has it is TOLD so (AppConsentProblems),
// with the command that writes the per-cluster entry, rather than being
// either honoured or silently ignored.
//
// An app that is present but not listed is still REPORTED, with
// allowed=false. That is what makes the portal able to say
// "present, blocked" instead of rendering it identically to "not
// installed" -- one of those an operator can fix, the other sends them
// looking for the wrong problem.
//
// LEVELS ARE THE OPPOSITE POSTURE, and on purpose (memql-cockpit#438,
// design D8). allow decides WHETHER an app may run here, which only the
// owner can grant; levels decide HOW it runs once it may -- which model and
// effort a LEVEL the engine names becomes -- and the cockpit ships an
// answer for that (internal/worker/harness BuiltinLevels). So an absent
// block is the built-in table, not "nothing":

//
