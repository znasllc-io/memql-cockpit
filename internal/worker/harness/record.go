// record.go is the RECORDING's wire shape: memql-cockpit#440, the cockpit
// half of epic B in the engine's
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-app-session-recording-and-learning-program-design.md
// (decisions D2, D5, D12 and D16).
//
// ONE SHAPE, WHICHEVER APP. Every tool call an app completes leaves the
// session as one `event` chunk carrying an Action, and the session's
// first event is a Fingerprint. Both are normalised here, on the machine,
// out of each app's own protocol -- Claude Code's tool_use / tool_result
// pairs, the Codex app-server's items, the Codex mcp-server's begin / end
// events -- so the engine never parses a vendor format. A reader that has
// to know Claude Code calls it `Bash` and Codex calls it
// `commandExecution` has been handed a parser for two formats nobody
// promised to keep, which is the thing this package exists to delete.
//
// NO PROTO CHANGE. AppSessionChunk already carries `stream` and a
// monotonic `seq`, and an `event` chunk is DEFINED as a JSON body. The
// type words below are namespaced for the reason resultEventType's is:
// the same stream carries the apps' own events verbatim, and Claude
// Code's last line is literally {"type":"result"}.
//
// THE ENGINE PARSES NONE OF THIS YET. Its half (memql#5396) turns these
// events into work-spine rows; until it lands, an engine at the pin
// appends every chunk to the session's bounded transcript and maps every
// event chunk onto a live progress line, which is where these land too.
// So this file DEFINES the shape rather than transcribing one, the way the
// model labels' `params` and `quant` were defined here first, and
// TestActionWireContract pins the names so a rename is a decision.
//
// EVERY UNKNOWN STAYS UNKNOWN. A fact the app did not report is ABSENT,
// never zero: an exit code nobody reported is not 0, a call whose result
// never arrived did not succeed, and a file this machine would not read
// has no digest. The engine records an absence as an absence; a zero it
// would record as a fact.

// written from the End, not from here). The last two are this side's,

//
//   - agent is the app's own bookkeeping: loading a deferred tool,
//     keeping its to-do list, handing a sub-task to a sub-agent whose own
//     calls are recorded separately. Nothing outside the app moved.
//   - other is a tool this package cannot classify, and its effects are
//     UNKNOWN. That is the fail-closed reading: a replay has to treat the
//     call as one it cannot reproduce, where guessing `agent` would let a
//     procedure skip a call that sent a notification.
