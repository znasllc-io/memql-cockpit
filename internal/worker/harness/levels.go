// levels.go is where a LEVEL -- the engine's word for how much intelligence
// a step needs -- becomes the knobs one app understands (design D8 of the
// engine's docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-app-session-recording-and-
// learning-program-design.md; memql-cockpit#437).
//
// THE TRANSLATION LIVES ON THE MACHINE because both halves of it are facts
// about the binary installed here. The knob NAMES are the app's own --
// Claude Code's --model and --effort, Codex's model and
// model_reasoning_effort -- and so are the VALUES: an alias Claude Code
// resolves to its newest model, an effort word one release accepts and the
// next ignores. The engine names a level on AppSessionStart; the machine,
// which can see the app, decides what that level means to it, and the
// machine's owner may overrule the built-in answer in policy.yaml
// (apps.levels, internal/worker/tools).
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS THE ENGINE'S OWN PACKAGE, not a copy. core/airoute is
// the routing seam's shared vocabulary, imports nothing but the standard
// library, and is what the engine writes AppSessionStart.level from -- so a
// level this file reads is by construction a level the engine can send, and
// a rename there fails to compile here at the pin bump instead of refusing
// every session on every machine afterwards.
//
// A LEVEL NOBODY CHOSE IS NEVER RUN. An empty level runs the app at its own
// defaults, which is what every session did before the field existed; every
// other outcome is either a translation or a refusal with a sentence. The
// alternative -- falling back to the defaults for a word this cockpit cannot
// read -- produces a session that reports a model nobody asked for, in a
// record somebody later reads as a choice.

// ErrEmbeddingsLevel refuses the one level no app serves (design D10).
//
// An embedding has to come from the SAME embedder as the index it is
// written into, or it lands in a vector space nothing else in the cluster
// shares -- a failure no reader downstream can see. Neither app exposes an
// embedder at all, so this is not a level an app is bad at; it is one an app
// cannot be asked for.

// Knobs are one app's own settings for a session, in the app's own words.
//
// A zero field is a knob LEFT ALONE, not a knob set to nothing: the app

// table say "this level runs the account's default model at high effort"
// for an app whose model names this cockpit cannot know.

// BuiltinLevels is the table this cockpit ships for the app a harness
// drives -- what every machine runs until its owner writes apps.levels.
//
// It is keyed by HARNESS WORD because that is the app's protocol, and both
// Codex harnesses share one table: `model` and model_reasoning_effort are
// Codex's words whichever way it is driven. A word this cockpit has no
// harness for gets no table, so every level refuses on it rather than
// running at defaults nobody picked.
//
// CLAUDE CODE names a model by ALIAS -- haiku, sonnet, opus -- which Claude
// Code resolves to the newest model of that tier itself, so the table does
// not go stale with every release. `fast` is Haiku with NO effort, because
// Haiku 4.5 takes none (the API rejects `effort` on it, and Claude Code drops
// the flag without a word, so passing one would be a knob that is silently
// never turned); `strong` is Sonnet at high; `reasoning` is Opus at xhigh,
// the setting Claude Code itself runs agentic coding at.
//
// CODEX sets the effort and NOT the model. Codex publishes no tier aliases:
// its catalogue is per account and its names change between releases (on
// 0.153.4 one account offers gpt-6-astra, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.5 and others),
// so a model spelled here would be a claim this machine cannot keep for
// anybody else's account. The account's default model runs, at low, medium
// or high -- the three efforts every model on that catalogue advertises. An
// owner who wants a particular model per level writes it in policy.yaml.
