// Package harness drives one coding app through its OWN protocol, so the
// cockpit stops reading terminal output and starts reading results.
//
// WHY THIS PACKAGE EXISTS. Until now an app session was one argv with
// stdin closed, and every piece of structure the engine wanted was
// recovered by guessing at stdout: chunks were classified by "does this
// line parse as JSON", a Codex run reported no usage at all because
// `codex exec` prints none, and there was no final answer -- only a
// transcript and an exit code. That is a parser for a format nobody
// promised to keep. Both apps ship a real protocol for exactly this
// (Claude Code's stream-json with a resumable session id, Codex's
// app-server JSON-RPC), and speaking them turns three guesses into three
// facts: what the app said, what it spent, and which session to continue.
//
// A TURN IS THE UNIT, NOT A RUN. The engine's app door needs to send a
// follow-up into a session it already opened (design D7). Neither app
// offers a process you can keep feeding: Claude Code's headless mode is
// one prompt per process, resumed by id, and Codex's app-server takes one
// turn per request over a connection it owns. So `Turn` is the verb here
// and a session is a sequence of them -- which is also what makes a
// mid-session credential renewal honest, because the replacement lands
// when the next process starts rather than pretending to reach a running
// one.
//
// THE HARNESS NEVER FORKS. Every process comes from a Launcher the caller
// injects, because the cockpit already has exactly one process supervisor
// (internal/worker/appsession/process.go: own process group, partial-line
// flush, SIGTERM then SIGKILL) and a second one would diverge from it
// quietly. A cancel that reaps only the direct child leaves an agent
// running on somebody's machine with nothing watching it, and that bug is
// worth having in one place rather than two.
//
// EVERY UNKNOWN STAYS UNKNOWN. Usage the app did not report is reported
// as not known rather than estimated -- the engine writes it to a ledger
// somebody bills from, and an estimate recorded as a measurement is worse
// than a gap. The same rule governs the structured result: no schema
// asked for, or nothing that parses, means no result, never an empty
// object that reads downstream as "the app answered nothing".
