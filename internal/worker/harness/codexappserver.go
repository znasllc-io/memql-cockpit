// codexappserver.go drives Codex through `codex app-server`: JSON-RPC
// 2.0 over the child's stdio, one process per SESSION and one request
// per turn.
//
// WHY THIS AND NOT `codex exec`. The old runner ran `codex exec <prompt>`
// with stdin closed and read the terminal. That gave no usage at all, no
// final answer distinguishable from the transcript, and no way to send a
// second prompt into the same conversation -- Codex prints for a person,
// and a person is not what was reading. The app-server exists for
// exactly this caller: it names the thread, streams typed items, reports
// what it spent, and takes the next turn on a thread it already holds.
//
// THE PROTOCOL IS CONFIRMED, NOT ASSUMED. Every method name, field
// spelling and payload shape below was read on 2026-09-07 from
// github.com/openai/codex at `main` (commit 5ecb3afd); the constants
// carry their source file. The prose documentation
// (developers.openai.com/codex/app-server, now
// learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server) names the methods but not the
// payloads, so the generated types under
// codex-rs/app-server-protocol/schema/typescript/v2/ are the citation
// that matters -- they are generated FROM the Rust structs that serialize
// the wire, rather than a description of them.
//
// EVERY DECODER HERE IS TOLERANT OF FIELDS IT DOES NOT KNOW, and that is
// a requirement rather than laziness. The app-server's payloads grow --
// `Thread` alone gained a dozen fields across the tags that were read --
// and the machines this runs on hold whatever Codex their owner
// installed. A decoder that insisted on an exact shape would turn every
// upstream release into a fleet-wide outage, reported as "the app went
// quiet".
