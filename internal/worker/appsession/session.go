// Package appsession runs the engine's app sessions on this machine:
// AppSessionStart / Chunk / Control / End over the worker stream, with
// the run, open and attach kinds (memql-cockpit#347).
//
// WHY A SESSION AND NOT A ToolDispatch. A dispatch carries ONE timeout
// and returns ONE result. A headless `claude -p` can run for an hour and
// emits output the whole way, so the shape has to be a stream: start,
// chunks while it works, control from the server, one end.
//
// A SESSION IS A SEQUENCE OF TURNS (memql-cockpit#386, design D2/D7).
// The run and attach kinds no longer fork an argv and read the terminal;
// they drive the app through its OWN protocol, via
// internal/worker/harness, and a `message` control starts the next turn
// in the conversation the previous one opened. That is what makes a
// follow-up a continuation rather than a stranger, and what turns three
// guesses -- what the app said, what it spent, which session to resume --
// into three facts. The `open` kind is untouched: handing an app to a
// human is not a harness turn.
//
// Three invariants run through the file, each because getting it wrong is
// silently destructive rather than loudly broken:
//
//   - `seq` is monotonic per session and is NEVER renumbered, including
//     on a retried send. The engine drops out-of-order and duplicate
//     chunks rather than appending them, because a transcript is a record
//     and interleaving a replayed chunk corrupts it in a way no later
//     reader can detect.
//
//   - `usage.known=false` when the app reported nothing. The engine
//     records that as billing "unknown", which is the honest answer; an
//     estimate would be recorded as measured, in a ledger somebody bills
//     from.
//
//   - the MCP configuration file is deleted on EVERY exit path. It holds
//     a bearer that cannot be revoked, so deletion is the control rather
//     than the tidy-up. See mcpconfig.go.
