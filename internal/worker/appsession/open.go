// open.go implements the `open` session kind (memql-cockpit#350): launch
// the app FOR THE HUMAN, with the workspace open and the prompt loaded,
// rather than running it headless.
//
// THE FAILURE PATH IS THE WHOLE POINT. An `open` that cannot launch the
// app ends the session immediately with a non-empty error. It must not
// return success and wait for a window that will never appear, must not
// fall back to a headless run -- the user asked to drive it themselves --
// and must not exit silently. An `open` that did nothing is
// indistinguishable from one the user ignored, and the plan waiting on it
// has no way to tell those apart.
//
// So this preflights before it launches: the app binary is resolved on
// PATH, the platform's terminal is resolved, and a display is confirmed
// where one is needed. Each of those failures names itself.

// openSessionExitFile is where the launcher records the app's own exit
// code, inside the session scaffolding so it is cleaned up with it.
