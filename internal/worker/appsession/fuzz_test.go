// returning something plausible that is wrong. So each property below

// directory, an id that escapes a directory, a bearer that survives
// redaction, a path an app names that the recording reads from outside
// the workspace.

// Content-Disposition header of an artifact download, and it is joined
// onto a workspace path. The property is that the result is a single
// path segment which cannot leave the directory it is joined to -- for
// any input at all, including ones no reasonable server would send.
