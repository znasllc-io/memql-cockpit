// `memql worker backup` -- what this machine is being asked to back up, and
// whether it will (memql#4841).
//
// IT RUNS THE SAME CODE THE WORKER RUNS, which is the discipline models_cmd.go
// states and the reason this exists at all: a second implementation could
// disagree with the first, and the operator would have no way to know which
// one lied. `--once` drives Manager.SweepOnce -- literally the function the
// loop calls -- so what an operator sees here is what the background worker
// does.
//
// The listing half is the one thing an operator actually needs when a backup
// is not working, and it is a question no other surface answers: the Files app
// can say "this machine said no", and only this command can say WHY, because
// the reason is in a file on this machine.

// backupSweepTimeout bounds `--once`.
//
// GENEROUS ON PURPOSE. A first sweep of the folder this feature exists for --
// client video -- is gigabytes over a domestic uplink, and a minute-long
// deadline cut it off mid-push: files were uploaded, the context tripped, and
// the whole sweep's ledger was discarded, so the next run re-pushed every one
// of them and versioned each again. (The ledger is saved on the way out now
// either way, which makes an interrupted sweep merely incomplete rather than
// wasted -- but the deadline should still be one a real folder can finish
// inside.)
const backupSweepTimeout = 6 * time.Hour

// backupListTimeout bounds the LISTING, which is two reads and should never
// take long. Separate so a slow cluster fails the listing fast instead of
// hanging for hours on a question with a quick answer.
