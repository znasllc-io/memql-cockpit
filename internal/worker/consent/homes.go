// Homes is the consent state of every cluster this machine serves: ONE
// MANAGER PER HOME (memql-cockpit#433).
//
// A consent window is an operator saying "tools may run on this machine
// now" -- and on a machine paired with two clusters, a single window
// answered that for both. A window opened because the operator was
// working with cluster A admitted `exec` and `fs_write` dispatched by
// cluster B, which is exactly the crossing a second pairing is supposed
// to rule out: each cluster gets this machine on the terms its owner set
// for THAT cluster. So each home's dispatcher asks its own Manager, and a
// grant names the home it is for.
//
// The kill switch is the exception, and deliberately: `consent revoke`
// with no home closes every window at once. Revoking is the safe
// direction, and a person reaching for it should not first have to
// remember which cluster they opened a window for.
