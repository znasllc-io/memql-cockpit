// `memql worker apps` (memql-cockpit#438).
//
// It answers the question an owner has the moment they write apps.levels --
// *what will this machine actually run, at each level, for each app?* -- and
// the one the portal cannot answer for them: why an app on this machine is
// not being picked. "Not installed", "installed but not allowed for this
// cluster" and "allowed but not signed in" all render identically from the
// cluster, as an absence; only the machine can tell them apart.
//
// It runs the SAME detector and reads the SAME policy the worker does, so
// what it prints is what a session would get. A second implementation of
// "which knobs does strong mean here" would be a second answer, and the
// owner would have no way to know which one lied.
//
// With --allow / --deny it also CHANGES the consent, per cluster
// (apps_consent.go), and the report that follows is the state the edit
// left behind.
