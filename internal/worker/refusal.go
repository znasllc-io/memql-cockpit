// refusal.go -- what the worker does when a cluster REFUSES it
// (memql-cockpit#427).
//
// A cluster that cannot be reached and a cluster that answered "no" are
// different situations, and the runner used to treat them the same way:
// warn, back off to fifteen seconds, ask again, forever. For a refusal
// that is the wrong answer twice over. Asking every fifteen seconds asks
// the same question of the same answer -- a revoked token is still
// revoked -- and the warning it prints every time is the kind of line a
// person learns to skip, which is how a machine stays quietly dead.
//
// So a refusal gets a HOLD: one error line that says what happened and
// what fixes it, a retry every minute doubling to every fifteen, a gauge
// on the metrics endpoint, and a record under the home's state dir that
// `memql worker config` prints. The first accepted handshake ends all of
// it.
//
// NOT DISABLED, deliberately. The engine answers Unauthenticated for a
// revoked or expired token AND for a token lookup that merely failed (its
// interceptor maps every resolver error to "invalid worker token"), so
// from here a database blip during a deploy is indistinguishable from a
// revocation. Writing `enabled: false` into the operator's workers.yaml
// on that evidence would turn one bad minute into a machine that never
// comes back. The hold is the answer that is right in both cases: cheap
// for a machine that was really revoked, and self-healing for one that
// was not. For the same reason one refusal is not enough to start it: the
// cluster has to have said no refusalStreak times in a row AND for at
// least refusalGrace, so a resolver blip shorter than that costs nothing
// but a few fast retries.

// refusalStreak is the fewest refusals in a row that can start a hold.
const refusalStreak = 3

// refusalGrace is how long the cluster must have kept refusing before the
// hold starts. At the ordinary backoff (1s doubling to 15s) that is about
// six attempts -- trivial for a token that really was revoked, and long
// enough that a deploy's token-lookup blip never parks the whole fleet
// for a minute.

// really revoked asks four times an hour, and one refused by a blip is
