// cannot observe has to be declared or left absent; inferring one from a
// model name would be a guess that fails at parse time, three layers from
// here.
//
// UNDECLARED IS ABSENT, for every field. Silence is not a zero this side
// makes up: an unstated size sorts last in the engine's ranking (D5),
// where a params of 0 would be this machine claiming a size it never
// read, and an unstated tools keeps the model out of tool turns (D11)
// rather than into one it cannot serve. The single exception is
// max_concurrent, which probeDeclared floors at 1 -- absent means
// UNLIMITED to the engine, so it is the one attribute silence must not
// reach it as.
//
// params, quant and tools are spelled here as the LABEL spells them,
// unlike context_window and structured_output: an operator comparing

// in both places, whereas `ctx` and `structured` are abbreviations nobody
