// Package models knows which local model runtimes this machine has, which
// models they can actually serve, and what to claim about each one.
//
// It exists for the same reason the apps package does: the engine cannot
// discover any of this. The cockpit dials out from behind NAT, and the
// engine reads what the cockpit reports on Register -- deriving the
// `model:<id>` routing labels the fleet router selects on (memql#4678).
// Nothing here decides whether a call happens; everything here decides
// whether this machine is ELIGIBLE to be picked.
//
// Three rules run through the whole package:
//
//   - EVERY CAPABILITY DEFAULTS TO ABSENT. The engine's attribute parser
//     is fail-closed: a model that says nothing about structured output is
//     never selected for a structured prompt. So a probe that cannot
//     establish a capability must say nothing rather than guess. The
//     failure a guess produces is not local -- a model that quietly answers
//     prose to a conductor turn produces a parse error three layers away,
//     naming nothing here.
//
//   - THE FLOOR GATES THE INVENTORY, IT DOES NOT ANNOTATE IT. A machine
//     below the hardware floor advertises no models at all. It stays a full
//     worker for everything else and nothing about it is degraded; it
//     simply is not an inference machine, and the reason is a sentence
//     rather than an absence.
//
//   - `models.allow` IS DEFAULT-DENY. Serving a call spends this machine's
//     own GPU on somebody else's prompt, so it gets the posture apps.allow
//     has: nothing is offered until the owner says which model may be. A
//     model that is present but unlisted is REPORTED as blocked rather than
//     omitted -- "present, blocked" is a state an operator can fix, and
//     rendering it identically to "not installed" sends them hunting the
//     wrong problem.
