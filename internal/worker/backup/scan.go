// The sweep: what is at the origin right now, and which of it has changed.
//
// ===========================================================================
// A SCHEDULED WALK, NOT A FILE WATCHER, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN
// ===========================================================================
// The obvious reach is fsnotify. It is the wrong tool for a backup, for three
// reasons that all point the same way:
//
//   - A BACKUP MUST RECONCILE, NOT REACT. Everything that happened while the
//     process was down produced no event, and an event-only design never
//     learns about any of it. The sweep IS the answer to "what changed while
//     I was not running", and once it exists the events are an optimisation.
//   - THE VERIFY LANE IS ALREADY A SWEEP. The cockpit is the only party that
//     can see the origin, so it has to look on a schedule anyway to answer
//     `stale` and `origin_gone`. One mechanism serving both is one mechanism
//     to get right.
//   - Recursive watches do not exist portably. Linux needs one inotify watch
//     PER DIRECTORY against a per-user cap, and a deep tree exhausts it with
//     ENOSPC -- which presents as a backup that silently stops noticing.
//
// It also adds no dependency, and the repo has none for this today.
//
// fsnotify remains a sensible ACCELERATOR later -- a debounced trigger for an
// early sweep -- but the sweep would still be the source of truth.

// Stamp is what makes a file recognisable between sweeps.
//
// Size and modification time are the CHEAP half and are checked first: a
// folder of client video is tens of gigabytes, and hashing all of it every few
// minutes would keep a laptop's disk busy forever to learn nothing. The digest
// is computed only when the cheap half moved, and it is what decides whether
// bytes are actually sent -- a touched file whose contents did not change
// costs one read and no upload.
type Stamp struct {
	Size    int64  `json:"size"`

// Unchanged reports whether the cheap half matches, so no digest is needed.

	return s.Size == other.Size && s.ModUnix == other.ModUnix
}

// Entry is one file the sweep found.
type Entry struct {
	// Path is absolute, as this machine spells it. It is half of the
	// (machine, path) key the engine versions re-pushes on, so it must be
	// stable between sweeps -- which is why it is never cleaned into a
	// different spelling than the one that was first reported.

	// silently dropped: a folder half of which is unreadable is a different

// Scan walks root and returns every file that should be backed up.
//
// ORDER IS DETERMINISTIC. filepath.WalkDir already walks lexically, and the
// result is sorted again so a caller comparing two sweeps is comparing the
// same sequence. A push order that varied between runs would make a partial
// sweep resume somewhere different every time.

// must not stop the other nine hundred from being backed up, and the count is
