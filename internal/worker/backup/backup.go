// THE INVARIANT, RESTATED HERE BECAUSE THIS IS THE CODE THAT COULD BREAK IT

// ONE-WAY, FOREVER. Nothing in this package reads the Library and writes this
// machine, and nothing anywhere deletes, moves or hides a copy because of
// something that happened at the origin. A file deleted here is FLAGGED there
// (`origin_gone`) and stays whole and downloadable -- because a backup whose
// copy follows the original into the bin is not a backup.
//
// Two-way sync and conflict resolution are refused deliberately. That is the
// complexity cliff this feature exists on the safe side of.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHO DECIDES WHAT
// ===========================================================================
// The GRAPH says which folder, where it files, what to skip -- so a person can
// set a backup up from a browser on a different machine while this one is
// asleep. THIS MACHINE decides whether it will do it at all: every path is
// checked against policy.yaml's backup.roots before anything is read, and a
// refusal is REPORTED rather than silent, because a machine that quietly
// ignored a watch would be indistinguishable from one that was offline.
