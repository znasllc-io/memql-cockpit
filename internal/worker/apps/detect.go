// WHY CACHE AT ALL. Detect runs on EVERY heartbeat -- the engine applies
// an inventory change to its live registry immediately, so signing into
// Claude Code makes this machine selectable on the next beat rather than
// the next reconnect. At a 15s beat, an uncached probe would fork two
// processes a minute forever on somebody's laptop, to answer a question
// whose answer changes when they run an installer.
//
// So the SLOW half is cached and the FAST half never is: the version and
// the harness probe come from subprocesses and are reused; presence and
// auth state are filesystem reads and are taken fresh every beat. That
// keeps the property the cadence exists for -- a sign-in shows up on the
// next beat -- without the process churn.
//
// It bounds the harness probe as well, under the version's name. Both
// answer "what did the operator install", and two probes allowed to go
// stale at different rates would report a Codex version read at one
// moment beside a Codex harness read at another.
//
// The cache key includes the binary's size and mtime, so an in-place
// upgrade invalidates immediately rather than waiting out the TTL.

// call or a harness probe. An app that hangs on its own version flag, or

// `codex app-server --help` every fifteen seconds forever, to re-learn
