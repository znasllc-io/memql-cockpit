// Package apps knows which local coding apps this machine has, whether
// they can actually be driven, and how to invoke them.
//
// It exists because the engine cannot discover any of this. The cockpit
// dials out from behind NAT; the engine reads what the cockpit reports on
// Register and every Heartbeat and derives `app:<id>` routing labels from
// it (memql#4359). Nothing here decides whether a run happens -- that is
// the engine's delegation policy plus the consent gates -- but everything
// here decides whether this machine is ELIGIBLE to be picked.
//
// Two rules run through the whole package:
//
//   - `signed_in=false` beats a guess. A label is derived only from an
//     entry that is BOTH allowed and signed in, precisely so the router
//     cannot select a machine that would then refuse the run. A
//     best-effort `true` produces a plan committed to a laptop that says
//     no, and the resulting failure names the router rather than the auth
//     state. So every probe here reports false when it cannot tell.
//
//   - `subscription` is REPORTED, never inferred. The closed set is
//     unknown / none / present, and "unknown" is the normal answer today.
//     The engine records unknown as billing "unknown", which is honest; a
//     value derived from "well, they have the binary" would be recorded
//     as measured.
//
// The engine's runnable set is closed (claude-code, codex). A cockpit may
// report more -- they are stored and never driven -- but there is no
// reason for this package to invent any.

// TWO OF THEM ARE CODEX, and that is the reason the engine must READ this

// `app-server` is still perfectly drivable through `codex mcp-server`,
// with a thread id in place of usage; a Codex that has the app-server
// gives up structured results and real accounting. Nothing off this
// machine can tell which one is installed here, so a descriptor derived
// from the id would be right on roughly half the fleet and would fail on
// the other half only after a turn had been committed to it.
// The words are ALIASED from internal/worker/harness rather than
// re-spelled here, and that is the one place this package does not follow
// its own mirroring convention. Mirroring exists for strings that live in
// the ENGINE repo, where importing is not possible; harness is in this
// module, so a copy here would be two definitions that a rename can pull
