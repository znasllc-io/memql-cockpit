// Limiter is THIS MACHINE's model concurrency ceiling, and there is one of
// it however many clusters the machine serves (memql-cockpit#432).
//
// A multi-home worker runs one Manager per cluster, so that one cluster's
// disconnect cannot end another cluster's generations. The ceilings are not
// the cluster's to hold, though -- they are a claim about this hardware, and
// every home's Register advertises the SAME numbers. With a ceiling per
// Manager, two clusters could each drive the full cap at once: N homes, N
// times the GPU the machine said it had. The Limiter is where the Managers
// meet, so the advertisement stays the whole truth about the hardware and
// the enforcement is the whole machine's.
//
// It is a SEMAPHORE: a call that finds the machine full waits for a slot
// (Manager.admit) rather than being refused, because the engine does not
// reroute a call a worker refuses -- it fails it.
//
// What each Manager keeps to itself is its own live set: StopAll on one
// home's disconnect still ends only that home's calls. The Limiter holds
// nothing but counts.
//
// It counts SLOTS -- calls whose model resolved and was admitted -- not
// calls merely registered. A call being resolved has taken nothing yet, and
// counting it would make two calls that arrive together against a ceiling
// of one each see the other and both wait for a slot neither holds.
