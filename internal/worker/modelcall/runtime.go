// Package modelcall serves the engine's ModelCall envelope from this
// machine's own model runtime (epic memql#4676, task memql-cockpit#362).
//
// The engine fixes the contract and picks the machine; everything here
// runs the call. Start / delta / end / cancel, correlated by request id,
// over the stream the worker already holds open -- the AppSession shape,
// because a generation emits tokens for as long as it runs and the caller
// wants them as they arrive.
//
// Four rules run through the package, and each one fails silently when
// broken:
//
//   - DELTAS CARRY A MONOTONIC seq. The engine drops out-of-order and
//     duplicate deltas rather than corrupting the generation, so the
//     sequence has to be produced correctly here; there is no repair on
//     the other side.
//
//   - THE ENVELOPE OWNS THE DEADLINES. Timeout, idle ceiling and
//     keepalive arrive on ModelCallLimits. A local 8B model on a cold GPU
//     is twenty seconds from start to first token, which is
//     indistinguishable from a wedged machine to anything holding only a
//     wall clock -- the keepalive is what makes the idle ceiling
//     enforceable rather than a guess, so a call with nothing to say
//     still has to say it.
//
//   - USAGE IS REPORTED, NEVER INFERRED. What the runtime said, including
//     which model it actually ran. Silence stays silence, which the
//     engine records as billing "unknown". A count derived from string
//     length would be stored as measured, and the only thing it could
//     corrupt is the loop-cap arithmetic that exists to notice a runaway.
//
//   - A SCHEMA IS HONOURED OR THE CALL FAILS. The router only ever sends
//     a response schema to a machine that advertised the capability, so
//     answering prose instead would defeat the gating that put the call
//     here -- and the parse error would surface three layers away, naming
//     nothing.
