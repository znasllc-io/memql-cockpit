# Watched-folder backup

Keep a folder on this machine arriving in a MemQL Library folder, continuously.

The arrangement is made in MemQL OS — **Files → Backups → Back up a folder** —
and this machine does the watching. Engine half: epic memql#4783. This half:
memql#4841.

---

## The rules, before the setup

**One-way, forever.** Files go from this machine to MemQL and never the other
way. Nothing MemQL does can change, move or delete a file here.

**A deletion here flags the copy; it never removes it.** Delete a file from a
watched folder and the copy in the Library is labelled *gone from the machine*
and stays whole and downloadable. That is the point of a backup, and it is the
one rule the whole design is arranged around.

**This machine decides which folders it will honour.** A backup is arranged in
the cluster — from a browser, possibly on a different computer — so the path in
it is one somebody else's screen named for this machine. Nothing is read until
this machine's own `policy.yaml` allows it.

---

## Setting one up

**1. Allow the folder here.** In `~/.memql/policy.yaml`:

```yaml
backup:
  roots:
    - ~/Clients
    - /Volumes/Work
```

Anything at or beneath a listed root may be backed up. The list is empty by
default and an empty list means *nothing*, not *everything*. `SIGHUP` reloads
it without restarting the worker (`kill -HUP $(pgrep -f 'memql worker run')`),
and roots MERGE on reload, so adding one does not un-authorise another.

`fs.deny` still applies: a folder you marked never-touch is not one to upload.

**2. Sign in on this machine.**

```bash
memql login
```

This is separate from pairing, and both are needed. The worker token this
machine runs on authenticates its *stream*; the Library needs a **user**
sign-in, and a PAT will not do (PATs verify only on the identity node). Once
signed in, the session refreshes silently — the worker never opens a browser.

**3. Arrange the backup in MemQL OS.** Files → Backups → **+**:
pick this machine, type the folder's full path, choose where it lands.

**4. Check what this machine will do:**

```bash
memql worker backup            # what is arranged, and whether this machine agrees
memql worker backup --once     # run one sweep now
```

`--once` runs exactly the pass the background worker runs. It needs this
machine to have registered at least once — the worker records its registration
id when it connects, and a push cannot name its machine without one. If it has
not, the command says so and does nothing rather than sweeping as nobody.

The listing shows **every** backup you have set up, on any machine, and marks
the ones this machine sweeps. A folder listed for another of your computers is
that computer's to honour.

---

## What it does, and how often

The worker checks schedules every five minutes. Each folder runs only when its
`intervalMinutes` has elapsed since the server’s last sweep report. New backups
default to daily; older arrangements keep their five-minute cadence. Missed runs
are combined into one catch-up run after reconnecting. `--once` runs immediately
but still respects paused status and local policy.

Ordinary uploads are independent copies and do not retain host paths or follow
local changes. Only a configured directory backup sends `backupWatchId`, which
the engine verifies against the caller, machine and directory. This reference
also travels with resumable upload sessions.

For each folder that is due:

1. Check the path against `backup.roots`. Refused → report *this machine said
   no*, with the reason, and stop.
2. Walk the folder. Skip hidden entries (unless the backup says otherwise),
   the usual derived directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`,
   `__pycache__`, …), and anything the backup's own *Also skip* patterns match.
3. For each file: unchanged size and timestamp → skip. Changed → hash it;
   same hash → record the new timestamp and send nothing; new hash → upload.
4. Report what was found: the file count and total size **at the origin**,
   which is a thing only this machine can answer.
5. Report any file that is no longer where it was, as *gone from the machine*.

Files above 32 MiB upload in resumable 16 MiB chunks, so an interrupted push of
a large file resumes rather than restarting.

**It is a scheduled walk, not a file watcher.** A backup has to reconcile —
everything that changed while this process was down produced no event — and the
liveness check has to look on a schedule anyway. One mechanism, and no watch
limits to exhaust on a deep tree.

## When it is not working

Run `memql worker backup`. It answers the three questions in order.

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| `Sign-in: NONE` | Run `memql login` here. |
| `Allowed folders: NONE` | Add the folder to `backup.roots` above. |
| `REFUSED: ...` beside a folder | That path is not under any allowed root, or `fs.deny` covers it. |
| `No watched folders are set up for you` | Nothing is arranged yet — set one up in MemQL OS. |
| `another machine's` beside a folder | That backup names a different computer; only that one sweeps it. |
| `no registered cluster matches this worker's cluster_url` in the log | The worker's `cluster_url` and the entry in `memql cluster list` name different hosts (a port on one and not the other is the usual cause). |
| Nothing arrives, no error | Check the Files app: a backup shows *waiting for this machine* until the first sweep reports. |

A folder listed for **another** of your machines appears here too. Only the
machine a backup names sweeps it.

### In the Files app

Each backup draws as a link between the machine and the Library folder:

- **Backed up** — everything at that path has arrived, as of the last check.
- **Catching up** — this machine has newer files that have not arrived yet.
- **Needs a look** — the folder is missing or unreadable, or files that were
  backed up are no longer at the origin.
- **This machine said no** — `backup.roots` does not list the path.
- **Waiting for this machine** — no sweep has reported yet.
- **Paused** — nothing is being copied; everything already there stays.

The *checked N ago* beside each one is what makes *Backed up* honest: "backed
up, last checked three weeks ago" is a different claim from "backed up".

## Not doing this

- **Two-way sync and conflict resolution.** Refused deliberately; that is the
  complexity cliff this stays on the safe side of.
- **Restoring from the Library onto this machine.** Download a file from the
  Files app like any other.
- **Following symlinks out of a watched folder.** A link would let anything on
  the machine be pulled in, which is the policy veto defeated from the inside.

## Source changes and interrupted transfers

The watched folder is a collection of individually linked originals. It is
separate from uploading a directory in Files, which creates one ZIP. Browser
uploads cannot discover an absolute host path; tracking requires an explicitly
configured watch and this machine's allowed backup roots.

Each changed file is first copied to a private disk spool. The source must
remain stable while that snapshot is prepared. Upload chunks read the snapshot,
so editing the original during an upload cannot mix two versions. Large files
therefore need temporary local disk space in addition to cluster storage.

Before the first chunk is sent, Cockpit durably records the session and the
snapshot's SHA-256. After restart it rebuilds the snapshot and resumes only if
the bytes match, not merely because the filename and size match. A lost commit
response is recovered from the completed session instead of creating another
version. An inventory outage keeps the existing session for the next sweep.
Orphaned local spools older than seven days are removed during preparation.

Renames and moves within one authorized watched folder preserve the stored
file and history when both filesystem identity (device/inode) and content
match. Copies, ambiguous hard links, cross-volume moves and moves outside the
watch are not guessed. The previous stored copy always remains available.

An unavailable watched root may be an unplugged drive. Its files are marked
**Unavailable**, not deleted. Individual originals are marked missing only
when an authorized lookup confirms they no longer exist. Excluded or unreadable
entries are unavailable. Host deletion never removes the stored copy.

Uploads carry the last known stored version. If another editor has changed the
stored file, Cockpit reports a conflict and preserves it. It does not write back
to the host or silently choose a winner. If the local ledger was lost, a matching
stored digest restores the baseline; unmatched content requires explicit review.
Trashed origins are refused by the cluster rather than recreated by the watcher.
