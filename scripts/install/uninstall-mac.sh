# ================================
#
# Remove memql-worker from a macOS machine: install-mac.sh run
# backwards, in one line, because an install that is one line and an
# uninstall that is a runbook leaves the token on machines nobody
# finishes cleaning up. Unloads and removes the LaunchAgent, removes
# the binary and its symlink, removes workers.yaml and worker.yaml
# (the tokens); --purge
# takes policy.yaml, the state dir and an emptied ~/.memql as well.
# Every step says what it did, or that there was nothing to do, and
# nothing here prompts except sudo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./uninstall-mac.sh [--cluster=URL|--all-homes] [--purge] [--user-local] [--dry-run]
#
# With neither --cluster nor --all-homes the script decides from the
# machine: one enrollment is removed as if --cluster=<its url> were
# given, none means the runtime files go (--all-homes), and several is
# a refusal that prints the exact command for each. Which install shape
# to remove is detected the same way: the per-user one (~/.memql/bin +
# ~/Applications/MemQL.app), the system one (/usr/local/bin +
# /Applications/MemQL.app, sudo), or both; --user-local narrows the run
# to the per-user shape. Both decisions exist because MemQL OS composes
# this as a one-liner and the person copying it should not have to know
# either answer.
#
# Scope: ~/.memql, the managed LaunchAgents, binary paths under the
# detected prefixes, and the standard MemQL app for each. Rollback
# copies remain. The machine's registration on the cluster is revoked
# from MemQL OS (Fleet -> Machines), not from here -- by the time this
# script could ask, the token that would have spoken for the machine is
# gone.

Usage: $(basename "$0") [options]

Removes memql-worker from this machine: the LaunchAgent, the binary
and its symlink, and ~/.memql/workers.yaml plus the legacy
worker.yaml (the tokens). Also removes the standard MemQL app and menu helper;
custom app destinations and rollback copies are retained.

With no options the script decides from the machine: one enrolled
cluster is removed as if --cluster=<its URL> were given; no enrollment
removes the worker runtime as --all-homes would; several enrollments
are refused with the exact command to run for each. The install shape
is detected too: the per-user install (\$HOME/.memql/bin,
\$HOME/Applications/MemQL.app), the system install (/usr/local/bin,
/Applications/MemQL.app, needs sudo), or both when both exist.

Options:
    --cluster=URL             Remove this cluster enrollment. Keep the app and
                              services if any other enrollment remains.
    --all-homes               Remove every worker enrollment and shared runtime.
                              Last/full removal resets MemQL app approvals for
                              Accessibility and Screen Recording only.
    --user-local              Remove only the per-user install under
                              \$HOME/.memql/bin and \$HOME/Applications; never
                              asks for sudo. Without it every shape found is
                              removed, and sudo is asked for only when a
                              system install is actually present.
    --purge                   Also remove ~/.memql/policy.yaml, the state
                              dir (logs, ledgers) and, once it is empty,
                              ~/.memql itself. Without it they are kept,
                              and the script says so. Refused while another
                              enrollment remains.
    --dry-run                 Resolve everything -- the enrollment(s) that
                              match, the install shape(s) found, every path
                              and service that would go, whether sudo would
                              be needed -- and print that plan without
                              changing anything. Exit 0, or the refusal the
                              real run would give before touching anything.
    --help                    Print this help

Exit codes: 0 everything that existed was removed; 2 bad parameter (or
several enrollments and none named); 3 refused; 4 a prerequisite is
missing (sudo, the binary a scoped removal needs); 5 a step failed. A
non-zero exit always names what remains and what to do about it.

The machine's registration on the cluster is revoked from MemQL OS
(Fleet -> Machines), not from here.
