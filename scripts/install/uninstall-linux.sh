# scripts/install/uninstall-linux.sh
# ===================================
#
# Remove memql-worker from a Linux machine: install-linux.sh run
# backwards, in one line, because an install that is one line and an
# uninstall that is a runbook leaves the token on machines nobody
# finishes cleaning up. Stops and removes the user-systemd units -- the
# worker's and, when `memql worker setup --inference` wrote one, the
# model runtime's (memql-ollama.service) -- removes the binary and its
# symlink, removes workers.yaml and worker.yaml (the tokens) and
# worker.env; --purge takes
# policy.yaml, the state dir, the native model runtime and its models
# under ~/.memql/ollama, and an emptied ~/.memql as well. Every step says
# what it did, or that there was nothing to do, and nothing here prompts
# except sudo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./uninstall-linux.sh [--cluster=URL|--all-homes] [--purge] [--user-local] [--dry-run]
#
# With neither --cluster nor --all-homes the script decides from the
# machine: one enrollment is removed as if --cluster=<its url> were
# given, none means the runtime files go (--all-homes), and several is
# a refusal that prints the exact command for each. Which install shape
# to remove is detected the same way: the per-user one (~/.memql/bin),
# the system one (/usr/local/bin, sudo), or both; --user-local narrows
# the run to the per-user shape. Both decisions exist because MemQL OS
# composes this as a one-liner and the person copying it should not
# have to know either answer.
#
# What this never touches: anything outside ~/.memql, the three systemd
# unit files, and the binary paths under the detected prefixes. The
# machine's registration on the cluster is revoked from MemQL OS
# (Fleet -> Machines), not from here -- by the time this script could
# ask, the token that would have spoken for the machine is gone.

Usage: $(basename "$0") [options]

Removes memql-worker from this machine: the user-systemd units (the
worker's, and the model runtime's memql-ollama.service when
\`memql worker setup --inference\` wrote one), the binary and its
symlink, and ~/.memql/workers.yaml plus the legacy worker.yaml (the
tokens) and worker.env. Nothing outside ~/.memql, the unit files and
the binary paths is touched.

With no options the script decides from the machine: one enrolled
cluster is removed as if --cluster=<its URL> were given; no enrollment
removes the worker runtime as --all-homes would; several enrollments
are refused with the exact command to run for each. The install shape
is detected too: the per-user install (\$HOME/.memql/bin), the system
install (/usr/local/bin, needs sudo), or both when both exist.

Options:
    --cluster=URL             Remove this cluster enrollment. Keep the binary
                              and unit if any other enrollment remains.
    --all-homes               Remove every worker enrollment and the runtime.
    --user-local              Remove only the per-user install under
                              \$HOME/.memql/bin; never asks for sudo. Without
                              it every shape found is removed, and sudo is
                              asked for only when a system install is
                              actually present.
    --purge                   Also remove ~/.memql/policy.yaml, the state
                              dir (logs, ledgers), the native model
                              runtime and its models under ~/.memql/ollama
                              and, once it is empty, ~/.memql itself.
                              Without it they are kept, and the script
                              says so. Refused while another enrollment
                              remains.
    --dry-run                 Resolve everything -- the enrollment(s) that
                              match, the install shape(s) found, every path
                              and unit that would go, whether sudo would be
                              needed -- and print that plan without changing
                              anything. Exit 0, or the refusal the real run
                              would give before touching anything.
    --help                    Print this help

Exit codes: 0 everything that existed was removed; 2 bad parameter (or
several enrollments and none named); 3 refused; 4 a prerequisite is
missing (sudo, the binary a scoped removal needs); 5 a step failed. A
non-zero exit always names what remains and what to do about it.

The machine's registration on the cluster is revoked from MemQL OS
(Fleet -> Machines), not from here.
