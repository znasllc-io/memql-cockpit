# scripts/install/lib_test.sh
# ============================
#
# Smoke tests for lib.sh's pure-logic helpers: install_mode_dir,
# require_sudo's failure mode, binary_name_for (headless + computeruse
# flavours), and write_worker_yaml (fresh write, 0600 mode, capability
# list, and its --force clobber guard). The /usr/local/bin system path
# can't be exercised in CI without elevated privileges, so the
# system-mode path is checked via the require_sudo failure mode.
# Also exercises the installers' own lib.sh sourcing: the cloned-repo
# sibling path, and the curl|bash fallback that fetches lib.sh from
# MEMQL_INSTALL_RAW_BASE when no sibling exists.
# And the release-asset preflight: preflight_asset's verdicts over
# file:// fixtures (present passes, missing exits 4 naming the URL and
# the flavour/platform pair), plus both installers refusing BEFORE any
# mutation when the asset is missing and proceeding past the preflight
# to the download when it is present.
# And the --inference pass-through: setup_inference's reading of the
# setup command's exit code (0 quiet, 3 prints the interactive command
# on ONE physical line, anything else reported), that it never fails the
# install, and that both installers accept the flag and call it after
# worker.yaml and the service.
# And the uninstallers: --help and the unknown-flag exit, lib.sh
# sourcing (they join the installers' loop), and real runs against a
# throwaway HOME with launchctl / systemctl / sudo cut out of PATH --
# what --user-local removes and keeps (worker.yaml + workers.yaml),
# what --purge adds, the
# nothing-installed run, ~/.memql kept for the CLI's clusters.yaml, and
# the fence that keeps a state_dir outside ~/.memql from being deleted.
# And the no-flag contract MemQL OS relies on (both platforms, a stub
# memql standing in for the installed one): one enrollment is removed
# as --cluster=<its url>, none proceeds as --all-homes, several refuse
# with the command for each; --cluster=URL with no enrollment proceeds,
# with no MATCHING enrollment refuses naming the enrolled ones, and
# matches through trailing slashes and case; a binary too old for the
# unpair contract (or none at all) falls back to full removal only when
# the requested cluster is the only one; the install shape is detected
# without --user-local; --dry-run prints the plan and leaves HOME
# byte-identical; and the exact piped one-liner shapes all parse.
# And the installers' --version pin: the composed download base, the
# space and = spellings, --download-base winning, and the bad-value exit.
#
# Run: bash scripts/install/lib_test.sh
# Wired into CI by .github/workflows/install-scripts-lint.yml.
